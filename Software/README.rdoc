**This Arduino scketch is a work in progress.  The program runs successfully on my solderless breadboard running both from an Arduino Uno as well as a bare ATMega328DIP.  I have included in the schematic a few optional features that are currently commented out in the software.  One being the BUTTON_2 being used to switch between a leaded and lead-free solder profile, as well as a FAN controll for those that have a Fan equiped toaster oven or those that wish to add a fan for additional convection.

The leaded vs. unleaded program has not yet been commited to GITHUB as I still need to work out some bugs.  I have it partially working on my test setup but with a few errors that I haven't worked out.  I may commit them to see if someone can help out debugging.  (I'm completely a n00b at this)

Also to note, the PID settings in this program work for my setup.  It's not certain that your particular setup will work out of the box with these settings, so some adjustment will most likely be required before it runs like a champ.**
